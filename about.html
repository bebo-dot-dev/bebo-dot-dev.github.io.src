<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm Joe Lippa, a software developer living in North West England, UK. In 1994 I started developing and maintaining C, VBA and VB6 code whilst at the same time working my way through University. Following graduation, I moved into my first full time "serious" software development job
and I was a Microsoft Windows desktop developer developing and maintaining applications in Borland Delphi for the next 8
years or so. Around 2003 it became apparent to me that my skills were becoming niche and somewhat marginalized 
so I made a move into web development and the .NET stack to make myself appear a little more appealing
to prospective employers.</p>


<p>I've been developing large business systems on the Microsoft stack for various organisations since the mid 2000's in a full stack role with languages and technologies like C# / ASP.NET / SQL Server / typescript etc and I've worked in various software related roles including software developer, senior developer, lead developer, team lead.
</p>

<p>That's not to say that this is all I've ever done. I've worked in engineering, electrical engineering,
domestic and commercial electrical installation work, security, sales, computer aided design and general IT support. A varied
list of things and a wealth of experience that makes me what I am today.. Here's a rundown list of some of the technical skills that I currently possess:</p>
