<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm Joe Lippa, a software developer living in North West England, UK. I've been developing 
software for what seems like forever although in reality it's been for the last 20 years. Back
in the day I started out in my professional work life doing bits and pieces of C, VBA and VB6 code in my day
job whilst at the same time working my way through University part time on a Computer Studies degree course. 
After graduating, I moved into my first full time "serious" software development job
and stuck with developing MS Windows desktop applications with Borland Delphi for the next 8
years or so. Around 2003 it became apparent to me that my skills were becoming niche and marginalized 
so I decided to cross train into web development and the .NET stack to make myself look a bit more useful
to prospective employers.</p>


<p>That pretty much brings us up to date; I've been developing large business systems on the Microsoft
stack for various organisations since the mid 2000's with C# / ASP.NET / SQL Server / the usual suspects etc.
Once upon a time I was a 100% Microsoft Windows type of person / developer both at work and at home but 
for the last 4 years I've been solely Linux at home and now only work with Microsoft stuff in my day job. In my own time
I mess around with embedded devices, firmware development and electronics forever in search of the next big killer app.</p>

<p>That's not to say that this is all I've ever done. Since leaving school I've worked in engineering, electrical engineering,
domestic and commercial electrical installation work, security, sales, computer aided design and general IT support. Yes it's a varied
list of stuff and that experience is makes me what I am today - whatever that is. Here's a rundown list of some of the technical skills I 
currently possess:</p>
